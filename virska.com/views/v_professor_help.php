	<h2>Thank you so much for using Virska!</h2>The main idea of the site is that when you create a section for your classes (MGT 101 - A, for example) students are able to search for that section and see all relevant information for that section. The assignments and messages that you create will be displayed to the student if they're "following" your section, so this page covers how to input the information that your students will ultimately follow.

	<h3>Adding Events to Your Sections</h3>
</div>
<div class="hCopy">
	<p>An "event" is a happening inside of your sections. It can be anything that is due on a date. An assignment ("Paper 1 Due"), an actually event ("Guest Lecturer from MIT"), a pizza party - an event is anything you decide and because students view your sections by day, they can see all of there events, from all of their professors, in one place.	</p>
	<p>To add an event, start on the <a href="/professor/dashbaord">Dashboard page</a> and to the right of the list of your sections that you've created, click on the "View" link. That will bring you to the page displayed on the right, and you can give the event a brief description, attach a document for your students to download to aid with the event, and even allow them to submit documents to you by clicking on the "Allow Submissions" button.</p>

	<h3>Viewing and Grading Submissions</h3>
</div>
<div class="hCopy">
	<p>When you enable the "Allow Submissions" feature when you create an event, students are able to upload their assignments for you to view, download, and grade.</p>
	<p>To see these submissions, go to the <a href="/professor/dashbaord">Dashboard page</a>, click on the "View" link to the right of the section in which the submission is related, and you'll arrive at the top picture on the right. For every event that you created with the "Allow Submissions" feature enabled, you can click on the "View" link in that event (where the red arrow is pointing), which displays the bottom picture.</p>
	<p>All of the students' submissions will be listed for you, and you can download their submissions by clicking on the blue document icon, give them feedback on their submission, and give them a grade. When you click "Publish to this Student," the information you provided will be available for the student to see. After you publish your grade and feedback, Virska saves it for you in this view so you can always change it should you have to. When you're finished with your grading, remember to message your students so they know to check out their grades! (Don't worry - we'll cover messaging next.)</p>

	<h3>Sending Messages</h3>
</div>
<div class="hCopy">
	<p>Messaging is one of the most powerful features of Virska. Right on your <a href="/professor/dashbaord">Dashboard page</a>, the bottom-most box enables you to send a message out to all of your students who follow your sections. A message can be anything you'd like - like "Project 1 grades are now posted!" or "Class on March 16th is cancelled" - and depending on the settings that the student has selected on their side of Virska, they'll receive an email, text, or both with your message. It's an immediate and comprehensive way to communicate with your students.</p>
	<p>To send a message, select the section to which the message will be sent, and simply type up a quick message and click the "Send Message" button. You can view your sent messages by clicking on the "View Sent Messages" link on the top righthand portion of the messaging box.</p>
