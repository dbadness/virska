	<h2>"My vision is simple...</h2>
	I believe that colleges and universities need a better website to manage their students' assignments, notes, documents, and more. I also believe that you're smart enough to know exactly what needs to be on that site. So I want to innovate, collaborate, and (most importantly) listen to you and build something awesome with you.<br><br>
	So here's the deal - I'm rolling out the site school by school and as I do, I want your feedback every step of the way. If you like a feature on the site - tell me. If you hate something - tell me. If you want to see something added.... you get the idea. Shoot Virska or me a tweet, send me an email, heck, send a pigeon if you have to but let me know how Virska can make college easier to navigate.<br><br>I've been through college recently, and did pretty well, but left with $200,000 in loans and a promise to make the experience better for the students behind me. My point is education is expensive so I want this project to make your education more valuable for you. I want Virska to add a little bang for that buck."<br><br>
