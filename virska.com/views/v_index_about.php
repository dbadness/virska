	<h2>"Our vision is simple...</h2>
	We believe that colleges and universities need a better website to manage their students' assignments, notes, documents, and more. We also believe that you're smart enough to know exactly what needs to be on that site. So we're here to innovate, collaborate, and (most importantly) listen.<br><br>
	So here's the deal - we're rolling out our site school by school and as we do, we want your feedback every step of the way. If you like a feature on the site - tell us. If you hate something - tell us. If you want to see something added.... you get the idea. Shoot Virska or me a tweet, send us an email, heck, send a pigeon if you have to but let us know how we can make college easier to navigate.<br><br>I've been through college recently, and did pretty well, but left with $200,000 in loans and a promise to make the experience better for the students behind me. My point is education is expensive so we're here to listen to how you think technology could make it better and more valuable for you. We here to add a little bang for that buck."<br><br>
