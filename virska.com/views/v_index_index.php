			<strong>Welcome to Virska;</strong> <i>a simple way to manage your assignments, documents, and notes in college.</i>

		<div id="headerCopy" class="homepage">
			<p>We're really excited to have Babson be the first school to help us test drive our new learning management system. We think the current solutions for learning management are awful, so we're out to create a simple way to manage college assignments and content. That's what Virska aims to do, and with your entrepreneurial spirit, we think you can help us make something great.</p>
			<p>Try it out, see what you think, and please give us feedback (both good and not so good) so we can improve Virska. We love Twitter&reg;, so send us a tweet <a href="http://www.twitter.com/virska">@virska</a> and we'll use your feedback to create an awesome learning management platform for all to use.</p>
