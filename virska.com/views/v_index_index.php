	<h1>"Our vision is simple...</h1>
	We believe that colleges need a better website to manage their students' assignments, notes, documents, and more. We also believe that you're smart enough to know exactly what needs to be on that site. So we're hear to innovate, collaborate, and (most importantly) listen.<br><br>
	<strong>So here's the deal:</strong> we're rolling out our site, Virska, school by school and as we do, we want your feedback every step of the way. If you like a feature on the site - tell us. If you hate something - tell us. If you want to see something added.... you get the idea. Education is expensive and we're here listen to how you think technology could make it better. We here to add a little bang for that buck."<br><br>
